Let's say you want to build an application for yourself. And you can do this in two ways.

Either you can build it from scratch, writing every single line of code.
You can build from other code and modify them according to your needs. But where would you get all these codes for your application?
Here what comes in handy is a package manager. It's like a code store from where you can get a different package of code and modify it for yourself by passing attributes and values.
